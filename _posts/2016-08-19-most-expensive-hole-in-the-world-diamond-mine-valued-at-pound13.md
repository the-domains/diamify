  Dubbed 'Diamond City', Mir mine in eastern Siberia is 1,722-feet-deep and has
  a diameter of nearly a mile The crater is so huge that it creates a vortex
  said to to be strong enough to pull helicopters downwards Its riches were so
  vast it helped transform the USSR from an impoverished nation into a world
  superpower With an expected value of £13billion, this could be the most
  expensive hole in the world.
